# OpenAPI with AWS API Gateway, Lambda, Cognito, SNS and CloudWatch logs

This repo only deploys the infrastructure via Terraform. The source code, [this](https://github.com/rpstreef/openapi-node-example) repo, will be deployed automatically via AWS CodePipeline. By default, it's configured to automatically deploy at every push to the master branch.

Check the companion articles series '_OpenAPI_' on [dev.to](https://dev.to/rolfstreefkerk/openapi-with-terraform-on-aws-api-gateway-17je).

# Get started

## The essentials

- Download Terraform v0.12.x [here](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html)
- You will need Node v12.x from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- Git, to clone this Repo, from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- Create a free AWS account (requires credit card) [here](https://aws.amazon.com/)
- Finally, download the [AWS CLI tool](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) 
- Setup your AWS local profile, see [this](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-profiles.html) guide how it's done.
- Manually setup an AWS S3 Bucket for Terraform state storage.

## To get the API running
If you meet all the pre-requisites, do the following

- In your AWS development account create the S3 bucket for your Terraform state files.
  - Optionally, encrypt the S3 bucket and enable versioning such that you can do a rollback.
- ```git clone``` this repo.
- Change your AWS credentials profile name in these files: 
  - ```./env/dev/remote-backend.tf```
  - ```./env/dev/dev.tfvars```
- Run ``` npm install ``` and then execute ``` npm run dev-init ```, this will:
  - Initialize the Terraform project for the 'dev' environment, and synchronize the state with the cloud stored .tfstate file.
  - If you run it a second time, it will fail on the workspace creation, this is not an issue (the workspace already exists)
- Run ```npm run dev-infra``` to prepare the deployment to your AWS account.
  - Note: this [repo](https://github.com/rpstreef/openapi-node-example) contains the node source code that the CodePipeline will deploy to the AWS Lambda and Lambda-layer.
  - Confirm with ```yes``` to deploy, anything else will cancel the deployment

ps. I'm aware the gulp file doesn't exit nicely, i'm not an expert. Any pull requests or issue reports with pointers is definitely appreciated.

## Running costs

There are no costs associated with deploying any of this on AWS, there is [Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free) coverage for limited free use.

The following services are deployed with Terraform;
- AWS Cognito
- AWS API Gateway
- AWS Lambda & Lambda Layer
- AWS IAM
- (Added) CloudWatch Alarms, costs will be incurred for enabling Detailed Monitoring for API Gateway (!)
- (Added) AWS CodePipeline, and CodeBuild with Github as source repository. There's a free tier for:
  - [CodeBuild](https://aws.amazon.com/codebuild/pricing/), 100 build minutes of ```build.general1.small``` per month.
  - [AWS CodePipeline](https://aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/pricing/): 1 free pipeline active per month.
